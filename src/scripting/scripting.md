# Scripting

A game based on Fyrox is a plugin to the engine and the editor. Plugin defines global application logic and can provide
a set of scripts, that can be used to assign custom logic to scene nodes. Every script can be attached to only one 
plugin.

Fyrox uses scripts to create custom game logic, scripts can be written only in Rust which ensures that your game will
be crash-free, fast and easy to refactor.

The overall structure of plugins and scripts could be described in this diagram:
