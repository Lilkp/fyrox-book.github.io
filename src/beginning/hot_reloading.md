# Code Hot Reloading

> ⚠️ This functionality is available on nightly version of the engine only. It will be a part of upcoming stable release
> of Fyrox 0.34.

Fyrox supports code hot reloading (CHR for short), which allows you to recompile the game code while the game is running. 
This functionality significantly reduces iteration times and allow rapid prototyping. This way Rust becomes a sort of 
"scripting" language, but with all Rust safety and performance guarantees. CHR in action looks like this:

## How To Use

CHR is quite simple to use - a project generated by `fyrox-template` already has all that is needed for hot reloading.
Yet, it requires some bootstrapping to start using it. 

> ⚠️ If you have an existing project from one of the previous versions of the engine, the best way to add support for
> CHR is to re-generate the entire project and copy all the assets and game code in the new project. CHR requires very

At first, you need to compile your game plugin using the following command:

```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C prefer-dynamic=yes" cargo build --package game_dylib --no-default-features --features="dylib-engine" --profile dev-hot-reload
```

This command will compile the engine DLL (`fyrox_dylib.dll/so`) and the plugin DLL (`game_dylib.dll/so`). Please note the
mandatory environment variable `RUSTFLAGS="-C prefer-dynamic=yes"`. It forces the compiler to link standard library 
dynamically. It is very important, because if not set, the standard library will be duplicated in game plugin and engine,
which will lead to subtle bugs.

> ⚠️ Environment variables can be set in a different ways, depending on your OS. On Linux it simply prepends the actual
> command, on Windows it requires a [separate command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1#examples). 
> Other OSes can have their own ways of setting environment variables.

The next step is to compile the editor in CHR mode. To do that, run the following command:

```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C prefer-dynamic=yes" cargo run --package editor --no-default-features --features="dylib" --profile dev-hot-reload
```

This command will compile the editor in CHR mode and run it. After this, all you need to do is to select build profile
in the editor to be `Debug (HR)`:

Once that's done you can run your game by clicking on the green `Play` button. You can switch between CHR and normal mode
(static linking) at any time. Keep in mind, that if you run the editor in CHR mode, it will also reload all changed plugins.

## Stability

CHR is very new and experimental feature of the engine, it is based on wildly unsafe functionality which could result
in memory corruptions, subtle bugs, etc. If you experience weird behaviour of your game after hot reloading, run the
game in normal (static linking) mode instead. Please report any bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues) 
of the engine. CHR was tested on two relatively large games - [Fish Folly](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/FishFolly) and 
[Station Iapetus](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/StationIapetus). You can download these projects and try CHR yourself.

## Technical Details and Limitations

CHR is using standard operating system (OS) mechanism of shared libraries (DLL for short). Pretty much any OS can load
native code into a running process dynamically from a DLL. Any dynamically loaded library can then be unloaded from the
process memory. This gives a perfect opportunity to reload game code in runtime. 

### Plugin Entities and Reloading

Plugins can supply the engine with a predefined set of entities (such as scripts, etc.). These entities are serialized into 
a memory blob before the plugin itself is unloaded. When all plugins are reloaded, this memory blob is used to restore
the state of plugin entities. That being said, pretty much all plugin entities must be serializable (implement `Visit` trait).

### Trait Objects

Trait object are very problematic with hot reloading, because internally trait objects contains vtable with function
pointers. These pointers can be easily invalidated if the plugin is unloaded. This applies even to engine trait objects,
if they're created directly from the plugin side. The only way to bypass this issue is to use special methods from the
engine to create its trait objects.
