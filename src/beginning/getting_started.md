# Getting Started

This section of the book will guide you through the basics of the engine. You will learn how to create a project, use
plugins, scripts, assets, and the editor. Fyrox is a modern game engine with its own scene editor, that helps you to edit 
game worlds, manage assets, and much more. By the end this section, you will have learned how to manage game and 
engine entities, understand how they are structured and have basic knowledge of data management in the engine. 

The next chapter will guide you through the major setup of the engine - creating a game project using the special project generator
tool.
