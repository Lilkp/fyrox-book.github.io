# Saved Games

Saved game is used to store progress made in a play-through of a game to disk or some other storage. It is very important
for pretty much every game and this chapter will help you to understand basic concepts of saved games in the engine.

## Saved Game Structure

This could sound weird, but saved game in most cases is just a scene with additional data. Let's understand why. At first,
when you're making a save file you need to take some sort of "snapshot" of your game world. Essential way of storing 
such data is a scene. Secondly, game plugins is also may store some data that should be saved. By these two facts, it 
is quite easy to get a full picture: to make a save all you need to do is to serialize current scene, serialize some 
other data and just "dump" it to a file. You might ask: is this efficient to serialize the entire scene? In short: yes. 
A bit more detailed answer: when you serialize a scene, it does not store everything, it only stores _changed_ fields 
and references to external assets.

## Usage

Fyrox offers a built-in system for saved games. It does exactly what said in the section above - serializes a "diff" of
your scene which can be loaded later as an ordinary scene and the engine will do all the magic for you. Typical usage of
this system is very simple:

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/serialization/save.rs:save}}
```

This is a typical structure of a game that supports saving and loading. As you can see, it is pretty much the same as
the standard code, that can be generated by `fyrox-template`. The main difference here is two new methods with 
self-describing names: `save_game` and `load_game`. Let's try to understand what each one does.

`save_game` serializes your current game scene into a file. This function is very simple and can be used as-is in 
pretty much any game. You can also write additional game data here using the `visitor` instance (see next section).

`load_game` - loads a saved game. It just asks the engine to load your save file as an ordinary scene. Note the difference 
with code in `Game::new` - here we use `request_raw` instead of `request` method. The main difference is that `request` 
creates a derived scene from a source scene, but `request_raw` loads the scene without any modifications. What is 
derived scene anyway? It is a scene, which does not store all the required data inside, instead, it stores links to 
places where the data can be obtained from. You can also think of it as a difference between your saved game and an 
original scene.

You can bind these two functions to some keys, for example you can use `F5` for save and `F9` for load and call the 
respective methods for saving/loading. Also, these methods could be used when a button was pressed, etc.

## Additional Data

As was mentioned in the previous section, it is possible to store additional data in a saved game. It is very simple
to do:


```rust ,no_run
{{#include ../code/snippets/src/serialization/save_custom.rs:save}}
```

The main difference here with the code snippet from the previous section is that now we have `MyData` structure which
we want to save in a save file as well as current scene. We're doing that in `save_game` method by 
`self.data.visit("Data", &mut visitor).unwrap();` which serializes our data. To load the data back (deserialize), we
have to wait until the scene is fully loaded and then try to deserialize the data. This is done by the last three lines
of code of `on_scene_loaded` method.
